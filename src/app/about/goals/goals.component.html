                    <p>With industry-leading technology, TrueChain aims to provide an efficient and well-governed blockchain 
                        for the decentralized economy. We came up with the first hybrid consensus incentive model to use economics 
                        as a drive to uphold and improve the chain. Meanwhile, we have also created a stable gas fee mechanism to lower 
                        the cost for the developers and operators of dApps, and to make the blockchain more public.</p>

                        entrepreneurs to be part of the TrueChain movement to building the future decentralized economy. Not only 
                        does TrueChain have a global developer community, we also have a library of open-sourced products that are handy
